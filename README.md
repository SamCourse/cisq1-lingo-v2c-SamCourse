### Introduction
Lingo Trainer is a back-end API for practicing the popular Dutch word-game 'Lingo'. The game has now gained more popularity internationally under the name 'Wordle'.  
The project is fully unit, integration, system and end-to-end tested using JUnit 5. Using GitHub Actions for CI, the application is fully tested through a pipeline.
Data is persisted using a PostgreSQL database utilising Spring Data JPA. The entire project is designed and built around the 4 layer architecture.
    
### Project setup
1. Ensure environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` match the given credentials in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
2. Run `docker-compose up` to start the PostgreSQL service in a Docker container.  
3. Verify the project's integrity with Maven, by running `mvnw verify`.  

The project is now ready!
